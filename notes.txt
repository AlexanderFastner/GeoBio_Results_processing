1. short summary reqs Cantata/busco4_tables/short_summaries
1 table for Transpi, 1 for trinity for each species
end result Table - species as rows, columns are numbers
include total BUSCO

start with demosponges
replicate file structure locally
2. Full Table
for each species 
	for Transpi + trinity | evigene(Transpi) | assemblies(Trinity)
		for each BUSCO gene
			make a file for that busco gene - ending in .fa
			from Sequence column grep that name in the corresponding transcript file ./evigene(Transpi) | ./assemblies(Trinity) - /netvolumes/srva229/molpal/Databases/CANTATA/Cnidaria/Acropora_aculeus/evigene> grep TransABySS.k41.R707698 Acropora_aculeus.combined.okay.fa 
				copy that header + sequence into the new file
954 x 2 files total	

WAIT!
3. go through BUSCO files
	possibly move to be outside of transcripts
	only need to download BUSCOs
	input file with species names
		get all the BUSCCOS for those species
